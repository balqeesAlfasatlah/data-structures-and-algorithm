## Solution :

tested in intelliJ and its working fine


##Unit tests written and passing :
- [x] Where k is greater than the length of the linked list
- [x] Where k and the length of the list are the same
- [x] Where k is not a positive integer
- [x] Where the linked list is of a size 1
- [x] “Happy Path” where k is not at the end, but somewhere in the middle of the linked list
