# Trees
<!-- Short summary or background information -->

## Challenge 15 Trees :

 - Create a Binary Tree class :
Define a method for each of the depth first traversals:

 + pre order
 + in order
 + post order

- Binary Search Tree
  Create a Binary Search Tree class with the following additional methods:
   + Insert
   + Contains
  

## Approach & Efficiency

+ Add :  Time: O(n) , Space : O(n)
+ Contains :  Time: O(n) , Space : O(n)
+ 
## API

+ Binary Tree class methods :

 1- preOrder :  root --> left --> right

 2- inOrder :  left --> root --> right

 3- preOrder : left --> right --> root 

+ Binary Search Tree methods :

  1- insert : take a value and add a new node with this value  to the right location in the binary search tree

  2- Contains : take a value and return a boolean indicating if this value in the tree at least once

# Challenge 16 : max

# Challenge 18 : fizz buzz tree 

Determine whether or not the value of each node is divisible by 3, 5 or both. Create a new tree with the same structure as the original, but the values modified as follows:

 + If the value is divisible by 3, replace the value with “Fizz”

 + If the value is divisible by 5, replace the value with “Buzz”
 
 + If the value is divisible by 3 and 5, replace the value with “FizzBuzz”
 
 + If the value is not divisible by 3 or 5, simply turn the number into a String.
