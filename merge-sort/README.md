## Approach & Efficiency

merge sort is a recursive algorithm, the time complexity can be expressed as :

+ O(n) time to merge the entire array then When solved, the **time** complexity will come to **O(nLogn)**.

+ The **space** complexity of the algorithm is **O(n)** as we're creating temporary arrays in every recursive call.

## Solution
tested in intellij
